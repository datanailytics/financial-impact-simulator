## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
2. Email your findings to security@yourdomain.com with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report"
3. Include the following information in your report:
   - Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, data exposure, authentication bypass)
   - Location of the affected source code (file paths and line numbers)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact assessment and potential attack scenarios
   - Your recommended fix (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receipt
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Patch Development**: Based on severity (see below)
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter after patch release

### Severity Levels and Response Times

| Severity | Description | Target Resolution Time |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Critical | Data breach, system compromise, or PII exposure | 24-48 hours |
| High | Significant impact on data integrity or availability | 7 days |
| Medium | Limited impact, requires specific conditions | 30 days |
| Low | Minimal impact, defense in depth improvement | 90 days |

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to this portfolio, please adhere to these security guidelines:

### Data Handling

1. **Never commit sensitive data**
   - No passwords, API keys, or tokens in code
   - No personally identifiable information (PII)
   - No proprietary or confidential datasets
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

2. **Data Anonymization**
   ```python
   # Example: Properly anonymize data before committing
   import pandas as pd
   from faker import Faker
   
   fake = Faker()
   df['customer_name'] = [fake.name() for _ in range(len(df))]
   df['email'] = [fake.email() for _ in range(len(df))]
   df['ssn'] = [fake.ssn() for _ in range(len(df))]
   ```

3. **Secure Data Storage**
   - Use encrypted connections for database access
   - Store data files in secure locations with proper permissions
   - Implement data retention and deletion policies

### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**
   ```python
   # Always validate and sanitize user inputs
   def process_user_input(user_input: str) -> str:
       # Validate input type and length
       if not isinstance(user_input, str) or len(user_input) > 1000:
           raise ValueError("Invalid input")
       
       # Sanitize special characters
       sanitized = re.sub(r'[^\w\s-]', '', user_input)
       return sanitized.strip()
   ```

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   ```python
   # Use parameterized queries, never string concatenation
   # Bad:
   query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
   
   # Good:
   query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
   cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
   ```

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to scan for vulnerable packages
   - Pin dependency versions in requirements files

### API Security

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   ```python
   # Implement proper authentication
   from functools import wraps
   from flask import request, jsonify
   
   def require_api_key(f):
       @wraps(f)
       def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
           api_key = request.headers.get('X-API-Key')
           if not api_key or not validate_api_key(api_key):
               return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid API key'}), 401
           return f(*args, **kwargs)
       return decorated_function
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting**
   ```python
   # Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   from flask_limiter import Limiter
   
   limiter = Limiter(
       app,
       key_func=lambda: request.remote_addr,
       default_limits=["200 per day", "50 per hour"]
   )
   ```

3. **HTTPS Only**
   - Always use HTTPS for API endpoints
   - Implement proper SSL/TLS certificate validation
   - Use secure headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

## Common Vulnerabilities in Data Science Projects

### 1. Data Leakage
Ensure that test data doesn't leak into training datasets:
```python
# Proper train-test split to prevent leakage
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Fit preprocessors only on training data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)  # Only transform, don't fit
```

### 2. Model Security
Protect machine learning models from adversarial attacks:
```python
# Implement input validation for model predictions
def secure_predict(model, input_data):
    # Validate input shape and type
    if input_data.shape[1] != expected_features:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input shape")
    
    # Check for outliers or suspicious values
    if (input_data < min_values).any() or (input_data > max_values).any():
        raise ValueError("Input values out of expected range")
    
    return model.predict(input_data)
```

### 3. Jupyter Notebook Security
- Clear output cells before committing notebooks
- Don't store credentials in notebook cells
- Use nbstripout to automatically clean notebooks

## Security Tools and Resources

### Recommended Security Tools

1. **Static Analysis**
   - `bandit`: Security linter for Python
