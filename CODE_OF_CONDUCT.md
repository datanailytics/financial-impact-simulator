## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

The Code of Conduct also applies to:
* Project repositories and all associated communication channels
* Project-related events and meetups
* Communications in issue trackers, pull requests, and discussions
* Social media interactions related to the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [your.email@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Process

1. **Initial Report**: Reports should include:
   * Your contact information
   * Names of any individuals involved
   * Description of the incident
   * Any supporting documentation or witnesses
   * How you would like the situation to be resolved

2. **Assessment**: Community leaders will:
   * Review the incident report
   * Gather additional information if needed

3. **Resolution**: Depending on the severity, actions may include:
   * A private discussion with the individual
   * A warning with consequences for continued behavior
